# Decisions Log

Short records of non‑obvious design choices and trade‑offs.

## 2026‑01‑19: Introduced AI workflow guardrails
- Added AI contract, architecture boundaries, and project map to prevent misplacement and local hacks.
- Future behavior changes should update the smallest relevant documentation and tests.

## 2026-06-19: Keep documentation consolidated
- Prefer one concise current guide over several historical notes.
- Keep AI instructions in `AGENTS.md`, package boundaries in `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  and contributor workflow in `docs/development.md`.
- Delete or merge stale documents when refactors make them misleading.
