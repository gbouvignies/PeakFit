"""Optional/experimental extensions for PeakFit.

This package is a staging area for non-core modules (plotting, analysis,
optional lineshapes, optimizers). Core code should not depend on these.

Modules here should provide stable adapter-style APIs and be imported from
call-sites that can tolerate their absence.
